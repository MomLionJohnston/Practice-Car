# Practice-Car
Question - Java Code in Eclipse IDE 
The below keeps giving me errors, can't get rid of the error ... help, please.

package practiceCar;

	main(String[] args) {
		class Simulator {
	public class car extends Simulator{
		}
	public class carPart extends car {
		int Engine;
		int FuelTank;
		int Wheels;
	}
	}
	}
  
  The project "Practice Car" ==> we must create a running car,
  with running parts (wheels, engine, fuel tank). The next phase
  is to add a function to the car parts with 100 being good to
  0 being broken. The above I was just creating the car. The error
  message is "Syntax error on token ";" record expected after this
  token"
